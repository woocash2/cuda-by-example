In pinned_mem_test.cu not sure why but the test results for C malloc and cudaHostAlloc do not differ much.
Probably a newer cuda driver is smart when doing stuff with memory.

Streams results:
Single stream:
	GPU time: 826.602ms
Two dumb streams:
	GPU time: 798.115ms
Two smart streams:
	GPU time: 799.034ms


The results are very similar between dumb and smart streams.
The conclusion is that a newer nvidia driver schedules the work in a smart way.
